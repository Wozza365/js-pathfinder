# js-pathfinder
A simple pathfinder demo written in JS using the Canvas API and Knockout.js (very basic)

A non-assessed piece of work as part of the Game Behaviour module on my Bachelor's degree at the University of Derby. The demo was completed in about an hour.

## Setup
Host a local server on your desired port and go to that location in your browser
### Python 3.x example:
`python -m http.server 8080` - Runs a local web server at localhost:8080

### How to use it
To see the output, open dev tools (F12 in most browsers).
Currently only works once, so you'll need to refresh to see new results. :(
